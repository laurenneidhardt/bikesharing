## Summary:
I think the examination of gender in this is skewed due to the fact that there are so many more male users. I think looking at the overall data is more useful and not much can be gathered by gender. The trends are generally the same between genders. I think further analysis of start and end points, do they start in residential areas and end in business areas during the morning rush and the opposite in the evening? That would give other cities an idea of how to attract commuters to citi bike and put them in the most profitable areas. I also think it might be interesting to compare their usage to weather patterns too.
